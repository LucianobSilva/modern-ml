# Machine Learning in Churn Case
- The bank, facing increasing competition, is concerned about customer churn but lacks both a formal churn definition and mature data practices. As a newly hired data scientist,    
    you’re responsible for creating a clear churn definition, implementing it, and using data to accurately predict churn—an effort previously unaddressed with only initial, informal behavioral rules providing limited insights.

- Binary Classification Problem:
    Churn = 1
    No Churn = 1


## 1. First look Data
- Read All files or databases historical (raw)
- Simple data describe
  - Handle missing values
  - Feature scaling (Normalization, Standardization)
  - Outlier detection


## 2. Churn Definition (Data Centric)
- Read All files or databases historical (raw)
- Merging Train Data and Test data (Full dataset)
- Define the Target and data splits 
  - Business knowledge??
- Define period splits (Train, Validation, Test)
- Created Full dataset in (processed)


## 3. Feature Engineering
- Feature selection (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination, L1 Regularization)
- Feature creation (e.g., debt-to-income ratio)
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
  - Tools: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

## 5. Model Selection
- Supervised learning algorithms
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (if applicable)
- Unsupervised learning (for anomaly detection)
  - K-Means, DBSCAN
- Tools: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Keras, TensorFlow

## 6. Model Training
- Train-Test Split (80-20 or cross-validation)
- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization)
- Cross-validation
  - Tools: Scikit-learn, Hyperopt, Optuna

## 7. Model Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve
- Confusion matrix
- Calibration of probabilities
  - Tools: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 8. Model Interpretation
- Feature importance
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Tools: SHAP, LIME

## 9. Model Deployment
- Deploy in production (API, batch processing)
- Monitoring and updating models
  - Tools: Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, ModelDB

## 10. Model Maintenance
- Retrain models periodically
- Check for concept drift (change in data distribution)
- Tools: AWS Sagemaker, MLflow, Airflow

## 11. Compliance & Ethical Considerations
- Fairness (avoid bias, equal opportunity)
- Interpretability and explainability
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, FCRA)
